# About
This repo contains Matlab and Psychophysics Toolbox (http://psychtoolbox.org/) codes for my MSc thesis project to be submitted to Graduate School of Neural & Behavioral Sciences at the Eberhard-Karls-Universität Tübingen.

This project is a modified version of Choice Blindness paradigm introduced by Johansson et al., 2005. Modification ideas are being developed by me and my supervisors; Andreas Bartels and Pablo Rodrigo Grassi. This experiment is being conducted at the Werner Reichardt Centre for Integrative Neuroscience (CIN).

ChoiceBlindnessExp() is the main function of the experiment, other necessary functions are being called in this script.

Further comments and explanations will be given in the future.

# Warning
All scripts are written on a Ubuntu 20.04 system, so please consider checking different operating system requirements for different functions. Also, most of the screen drawings are based on visual degress, but some might still based on pixel values. I plan to update and optimize all functions.

# Local Development 
This project is still in progress, new updates can be found in feature-updates branch
